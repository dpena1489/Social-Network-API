## Description

This application serves as the backend for a social media platform. It features API routes facilitating user management, post creation, updating, and deletion, as well as reactions to those posts. All data generated by the app is stored in a MongoDB database.


## Installation

To use the app, you'll need to install Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. After installation, you can start the app by running npm run start from the command line. Since there's no graphical interface, you'll need an API client like Insomnia to interact with the database.

## Usage

In your API client, input the URL corresponding to the route you wish to engage with. Details about these routes can be found in the routes/api directory.
If needed, input the JSON object required to execute the command. Descriptions of the available models can be found in the models directory.
